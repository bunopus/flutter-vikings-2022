## Find an error

### How to play
Player chooses desired difficulty (_easy_, _medium_, _hard_). There are `task_name.dart` files in `tasks` directory. Each file represents one task.
Challenge is to fix an error that prevents code to work properly. Usually it should be one line in code, but at hardest levels it can be more than that.
Player should fix that error so app runs as intended. There is a time cap: 10 minutes for hard tasks, 5 - for easy ones.

### How to contribute
Put `task_name.dart` file in repsective folder (_hard_, _easy_, _medium_). It should be dart code with `main` function, so later it can be just copied to zapp.run `main.dart` file. Error should be not so obvious (at least solution shouldn't be immideatly provided by IDE). But on the other hand – solvable. If you wish – you can prepare _zapp.run_ project and just add a link to it as `task_name.link` file.

### How to operate
Copy task_name.dart into https://zapp.run/ editor window and run it. Each file should contain _main_ function.
OR
For higher levels it can be pre-made zapp.run project, just open the link from respective file.
